Tor Sensor

## Tor Integration
Tor Sensor requires installing Tor Browser or running Tor as a daemon.
This is accomplished by the 1M5 Tor Sensor by using the local Tor Browser's SOCKSv5 proxy address and port.
If you do not have Tor installed: 

Tor Browser: https://www.torproject.org/download/download.html.en
Or as a daemon: 
1. sudo apt install tor
2. tor
