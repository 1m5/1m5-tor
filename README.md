Tor Sensor

## Tor Integration
Tor Sensor requires installing Tor Browser as it's the recommended service for using the Tor network.
This is accomplished by the 1M5 Tor Sensor by using the local Tor Browser's SOCKSv5 proxy address and port.
If you do not have Tor Browser installed, please do so: https://www.torproject.org/download/download.html.en
